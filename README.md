# Material-Identifier-using-simple-Experiments
This is a C++-based simulator which classifies materials using Hall Effect and Magnetoresistance data. It identifies whether a sample is a metal, n-type semiconductor, p-type semiconductor, insulator, or heavily doped semiconductor/poor metal, while also calculating key electrical properties.
